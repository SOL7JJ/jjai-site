## ⚙️ Architecture

- `index.html` provides the root `<div id="root">`
- `main.jsx` bootstraps the React application
- `App.jsx` contains layout, sections, and reusable components
- `styles.css` handles theming and responsive layout
- `vite.config.js` configures the base path for production deployment

The application is structured as a single-page React application (SPA).
